    "description": "The Americano cocktail has a complex taste profile characterized by a balanced mix of herbal, bitter, and slightly sweet flavors. Campari brings a pronounced bitterness with a hint of citrus and herbal notes. The vermouth adds a blend of sweet and spiced flavors, which temper the bitterness of the Campari. The twists of lemon and orange peel contribute a refreshing and aromatic citrus hint, brightening up the drink.\n\nOverall, the Americano is a well-rounded cocktail that starts with a sharp, bitter kick from the Campari, mellowed by the sweet vermouth, and finishes with a crisp citrus zest from the lemon and orange peels. It tends to appeal to those who enjoy complex, bittersweet beverages rather than overly sweet or sour drinks. If you appreciate layered flavors with a bit of an herbal bite followed by a smooth finish, you might find the Americano quite enjoyable.",

    "description": "The \"After Dinner Cocktail\" has a balanced and complex taste, with a mix of sweet, fruity, and tangy flavors. The apricot brandy provides a rich, fruity sweetness, while the triple sec adds a citrusy sweetness that complements it. The juice of lime and the additional lime contribute a sharp, tangy acidity that cuts through the sweetness, making the cocktail refreshing without being overly sweet. If you enjoy drinks that have a harmonious blend of fruity sweetness and tartness, this cocktail might be appealing to you.",
